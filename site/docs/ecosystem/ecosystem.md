Egeria ecosystems, consist of platforms, on which servers run; these servers run services and communicate using cohorts. The ecosystem tools allows an infrastructure architect to configure, define, explore, navigate and operate the eco-system. Services work on open types and instances of these open types; these can also be explored using these tools. The ecosystem tools are 

- Type Explorer: allowing a user to explore the Egeria open types
- [RepositoryExplorer](./RepositoryExplorerGuide.md) : allowing a user to explore Egeria instances
- Server Author: allowing a user to configure a server. This is work in progress.
- Dino: allowing a user to see and work with Egeria platforms and servers operationally.
